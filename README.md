##Purpose##

IOU is an Android application that helps groups keep track of expenses. This project was developed as an individual project for Professor Gudrun Socher’s CPE 305 at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in Fall 2016.

##How to Use##
This application (in the near future) will be available for download on the Google Play Store. The application requires a Google account to use as well as a phone that is running Android as it’s OS. The application supports API Level 16 and above which is Jelly Bean and newer.

Until it is on the Google Play Store, clone this directory and open up the project on Android Studio. Run this application on any emulator that supports API Level 16 and above.

##Functionality##
