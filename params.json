  "body": "# IOU\r\n\r\nIOU is an Android application that helps groups keep track of expenses. This project was developed as an individual project for Professor Gudrun Socherâ€™s CPE 305 at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in Fall 2016.\r\n\r\n_Sarah Padlipsky_\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\nToday's world moves at an unprecedented pace. People in all stages of life find themselves struggling to keep up with the amount of responsibilities they have. \r\n\r\nAn average mom has to plan their children's soccer team party, get a gift for her boss at work from the team, and plan Thanksgiving dinner for over 30 people. While exhausting, these three events are also costly if she does not make sure she gets paid back. That is where IOU comes in! \r\n\r\nNow this mom can:\r\n* Make three different groups for these events\r\n* Add necessary people to all of these groups \r\n* Keep track of what she's spent and what others have spent\r\n* Make sure she gets paid back for her efforts!\r\n\r\n## Walk-Through of the Application\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Logging in\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Adding Groups\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Viewing Groups\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Adding Bills\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Calculating IOU\r\n\r\n### Step 6: Making Note of Pay Back\r\n\r\n\r\n##Current View of Architecture##\r\nThe following class diagram shows the current architecture used in the IOU application. The architecture is a MVP pattern (Model-View-Presenter), which is a variation of the better known MVC architecture. \r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-sarahpadlipsky/blob/master/Documents/diagrams/MVPOverview.png?raw=true)\r\n### What is MVP?\r\n* View is a layer that displays data and reacts to user actions. \r\n * In this application, these are the XML files. \r\n* Model is a data access layer.\r\n * In this application, this is the java files; including logic and data containers. As well as the Realm Database. \r\n* Presenter is a layer that provides View with data from Model. \r\n * In this application, this is the Activity classes.\r\n\r\nAndroid uses the MVP pattern because the the view and the model classes do not interact. All changes must go through the activities to change the model/what the user sees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
